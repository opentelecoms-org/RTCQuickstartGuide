  <title>Community support</title>

  <para>Many technologies and companies have a presence on the Internet
  for support and interaction between between users and developers.  This
  model of community support is particularly relevant for RTC technology.
  RTC, by definition, requires interoperability between all those using the
  technology and efficient online collaboration helps to identify and
  resolve interoperability problems.  Many users also have common problems
  to solve, such as the collaboration between Internet companies to
  eliminate spam.</para>

  <para>In the RTC domain, there are a range of online communities with
  various objectives.  The objectives include supporting specific pieces
  of software, development of standards, discussion of operational issues
  between providers and advocacy of open standards and private
  communication.</para>
