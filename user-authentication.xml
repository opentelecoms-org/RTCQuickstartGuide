  <title>User and credential storage</title>

  <para>Most of the products described in this document, including
  SIP proxies, XMPP servers, TURN servers and soft PBXes offer a range
  of choices for maintaining a user database and storing user
  credentials.</para>

      <title>Personal account names or extension numbers</title>

      <para>An issue that arises early in many discussions about this
      topic is whether to use email addresses of the form
      <literal>username@example.org</literal> or to use extension
      numbers as the account identifiers.</para>

      <para>In most cases, users still need to be able to be contactable
      using either type of address, but the question remains: should
      their phone login to the system using a named username or using an
      extension number?</para>

      <para>Extension numbers are the standard in many traditional phone
      systems and some people have simply tried to replicate this model
      when moving to IP-based RTC.</para>

      <para>There are three big reasons why numbers are popular:
      numbers can be dialed from anywhere else in the PSTN,
      numbers are easier to dial for people who are not calling from a
      computer (phones only have 12 buttons) and there is not always
      a one-to-one mapping between people and phones.  One additional
      feature of numbers is that they are slightly less personal,
      somebody does not know exactly who will answer when they
      call a landline in a house shared by a large family and when
      somebody leaves a job, their phone number can be assigned to
      their successor.</para>

      <para>Mobile telephones and smartphones in particular have
      dramatically reduced the significance of these factors that encouraged
      the continued use of numbers.  For example, the inconvenience of manually
      dialing a SIP or XMPP address is not such a big factor because people are
      more likely to have these details in their address books.</para>

      <para>Phone numbers also have disadvantages.  One of these is the
      dependency on phone companies, the ITU and government bureaucracies
      who administer the numbering system.  Users can be forced to change
      their phone number when changing provider.  Dialing codes change,
      making it necessary to update old records in an address book.
      Each group of numbers is tightly bound to the infrastructure of a
      specific the telephone exchange, leading to inflexibility when relocating
      or when a local service outage occurs.</para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Recommendation</title>

        <para>Use alphabetic usernames rather than extension numbers
        internally.  SIP, XMPP and email each support a slightly different
        set of characters in usernames so only use the set of characters
        supported for all protocols.  Wherever a device is being used with
        named accounts, such as a desktop PC where users login and have
        access to their own company email account, or a smartphone that
        is only used by one person and has been configured to access
        a named email account, provision the same personalized SIP/XMPP
        address on that device.  Where a device is shared, such as a
        conference room phone, create a named account for that purpose.</para>

        <para>It is generally helpful if the same username is used for
        login, email address, SIP and XMPP addresses.  If the login names
        are not the same as email addresses, use the email addresses as
        the SIP and XMPP addresses.</para>

        <para>To give users the convenience of dialing extension numbers
        from regular phones, create mappings from the extension numbers
        to the usernames.</para>

        <para>This strategy offers significantly more potential for
        the future as more and more services will rely on usernames and
        fewer services will place emphasis on phone numbers.</para>

        <para>When using this strategy, it is necessary to implement
        mappings from phone numbers to usernames as part of the
        <emphasis>ingress</emphasis> processing and for calls that go
        out to the PSTN over SIP or ISDN trunks, it is necessary to
        implement the reverse mapping, ensuring that the caller ID of each
        outgoing call is personalized based on the internal username.</para>

      <title>Password encryption</title>

      <para>It is not strictly necessary to use passwords for SIP, XMPP
      and TURN, you can use certificate authentication instead.
      Nonetheless, many people find that some of their users can only
      support password authentication or they don't want the complexity
      of managing public key infrastructure (PKI).</para>

      <para>XMPP transmits passwords in cleartext, so all XMPP
      connections should be secured with TLS to avoid eavesdropping.
      The benefit of this approach is that XMPP users can be
      authenticated against any type of pre-hashed passwords or using
      a method such as LDAP bind to verify the supplied credential.</para>

      <para>SIP and TURN use a DIGEST algorithm very similar to
      HTTP DIGEST.  The DIGEST algorithm requires the server to have
      either an unencrypted copy of the password, a password encrypted
      with the HA1 algorithm or a service (such as RADIUS) that can
      perform delegated DIGEST authentication.</para>

      <para>If unencrypted passwords are available, then the SIP and
      TURN servers can use them to construct the HA1 hash value or
      you can precompute the HA1 values and store them in a database.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>HA1 hash values should be considered as sensitive as
        unencrypted passwords.  Even though the plaintext password can't
        be recovered in a simple manner, anybody in possession of the
        HA1 value is able to use it to construct a response to a HTTP
        or SIP DIGEST challenge, thereby impersonating the user who
        owns that password.  Therefore, do not keep HA1 hash values in
        world-readable configuration files or publicly accessible in
        LDAP.</para>
      </warning>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>HA1 in detail</title>

      <para>The HA1 hash includes the username, the password and the realm.
      A HA1 hash can be easily constructed at the UNIX command line
      as demonstrated in <xref linkend="auth-make-ha1"/>.</para>

      authenticates using the username <code>alice@example.org</code>.
      This second permutation is referred to by some products as
      <emphasis>HA1B</emphasis>.  Some people prefer to use the full
      <emphasis>user@domain</emphasis> syntax to support virtual hosting
      with a single <emphasis>realm</emphasis> value on a single SIP
      proxy or TURN server.</para>

      <title>RADIUS</title>

      <para>IETF <code>draft-sterman-aaa-sip-04</code> describes a
      mechanism for RADIUS servers to participate in a SIP DIGEST
      challenge/response without the SIP proxy having a copy of the
      password or HA1 value at all.  This is implemented by the
      <emphasis>FreeRADIUS</emphasis> project in the module
      <link xlink:href="http://wiki.freeradius.org/modules/Rlm_digest">
      <code>rlm_digest</code></link> and supported by all the major
      SIP proxy servers.</para>

      <para>At the time of writing, work is in progress to enable RADIUS
      to participate in TURN authentication in the same way.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>LDAP</title>

      <para>If LDAP is in use, you may wish to consider storing the
      HA1 values in the LDAP directory.  Each time a user is created
      or a user changes their password, the LDAP server will need to
      update the HA1 hash as well as updating any other copies of the
      password hashed with other algorithms.</para>

      <para>For example, the <emphasis>OpenLDAP</emphasis> server
      allows such logic to be implemented in an overlay, this is
      already demonstrated in the <emphasis>smbk5pwd</emphasis> module
      for hashing copies of the user's password in various algorithms
      used by Windows.</para>

      <para>Due to the sensitive nature of the HA1 values, they
      should be stored in an attribute that is not readable to any
      other user or anonymous access.  <xref linkend="openldap-acl-ha1"/>
      demonstrates how to protect the <code>ha1Password</code> so it can
      only be read by a user
      <code>cn=sip-proxy,dc=example,dc=org</code>.</para>

        by dn="cn=sip-proxy,dc=example,dc=org" read
        by anonymous auth
        by * none </programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>LDAP can also be used to assist in routing as described in
      <xref linkend="enum"/>.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="user-authentication-sql">
      <title>SQL databases</title>

      <para>Many RTC products have some capability to interact with an
      SQL database to obtain user credentials, configuration settings
      and routing information.  <xref linkend="postgresql-users-repro"/>
      demonstrates a typical schema.</para>

      <example xml:id="postgresql-users-repro">
        <title>SQL table for repro users</title>
        <programlisting format="linespecific">CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
  domain VARCHAR(253),
  realm VARCHAR(253),
  passwordHash VARCHAR(32),
  passwordHashAlt VARCHAR(32),
  name VARCHAR(256),
  email VARCHAR(256),
  forwardAddress VARCHAR(256)
);</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>Each product has a different schema, however, it is possible
      to create a user list table that aggregates all the columns
      required to satisfy multiple processes and then create SQL views to
      present the data with the column names required by the individual
      applications.  For example, a single user list table can be created
      for use by Asterisk (the <literal>sippeers</literal> table) and used
      by repro (using a view instead of a real <literal>users</literal> table)
      as demonstrated in <xref linkend="postgresql-view-repro-asterisk"/>.
      repro simply doesn't require many of the columns used by Asterisk.
      Notice that Asterisk's <literal>sippeers</literal> table doesn't
      contain a domain or realm column for each user, these are stored
      elsewhere in the <literal>sip.conf</literal> file, so for repro, they
      are specified as constant values in the <literal>SELECT</literal> query.
      </para>

      <example xml:id="postgresql-view-repro-asterisk">
        <title>SQL view presenting Asterisk users to repro</title>
        <programlisting format="linespecific">CREATE VIEW users AS

    NULL AS name,
    NULL AS email,
    NULL AS forwardAddress

      <title>Product-specific file formats</title>

      <para>Each product also supports some native file formats.
      For example, <emphasis>repro</emphasis> can store user data in
      <emphasis>Berkeley DB</emphasis> files while
      <emphasis>Asterisk</emphasis> can store users in the
      <code>sip.conf</code> text file.  The <emphasis>Prosody</emphasis>
      XMPP server can store its data in JSON files.  In some cases, the
      files are maintained by the administrator using a text editor and
      in other cases they are updated at runtime by the application.</para>

      <para>To eliminate the risk of runtime dependencies on databases,
      it is relatively straightforward to create a script that
      periodically extracts user data from a database and creates files
      for the relevant processes to consume.  If one of the processes has
      to start up or continue operating during a database outage, it will
      be able to do so using the last copy of the file.</para>
