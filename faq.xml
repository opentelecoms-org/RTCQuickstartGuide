    <title>Can I use a virtual server for SIP or XMPP?</title>

    <para>For small installations (less than 30 concurrent phone calls) a
    virtual server running on modern hardware is more than sufficient.</para>

    <para>For demanding use-cases, it is recommended that any real-time
    processes (such as the TURN server or a soft PBX like Asterisk or
    FreeSWITCH) be on dedicated servers while it may still be possible for
    the SIP proxy or XMPP server to be on a virtual server.</para>

    <title>Do I really need to use TLS encryption and certificates?</title>

    <para><emphasis>Yes</emphasis>.  Even if you don't care too much about
    security or privacy, TLS helps to reduce the risk of nuisance calls from
    spammers and the risk of impersonation and it also eliminates a range of
    problems caused by SIP-aware routers that try to modify SIP messages to
    help them through NAT.</para>
